## Project Scope:
Unix Shell based on the tutorial of Stephen Brennan
This is a very basic implementation that consists of the shell commands:
- cd
- help
- exit

## Limitations:
- Commands must be on a single line.
- Arguments must be separated by whitespace.
- No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.
- No piping or redirection.
- Only builtins are: cd, help, exit.
